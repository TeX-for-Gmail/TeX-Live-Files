shortdesc Turkish hyphenation patterns.
longdesc Hyphenation patterns for Turkish in T1/EC and UTF-8 encodings.
longdesc Auto-generated from a script included in the distribution. The
longdesc patterns for Turkish were first produced for the Ottoman Texts
longdesc Project in 1987 and were suitable for both Modern Turkish and
longdesc Ottoman Turkish in Latin script, however the required character
longdesc set didn't fit into EC encoding, so support for Ottoman Turkish
longdesc had to be dropped to keep compatibility with 8-bit engines.
