shortdesc Run Python from within a document, typesetting the results
longdesc The package allows you to enter Python code within a LaTeX
longdesc document, execute the code, and access its output in the
longdesc original document. Python code is only executed when it has
longdesc been modified, or when it meets user-specified criteria. Code
longdesc may be divided into user-defined sessions, which automatically
longdesc run in parallel. Errors and warnings are synchronized with the
longdesc LaTeX document, so that they refer to the document's line
longdesc numbers. External dependencies can be tracked, so that code is
longdesc re-executed when the data it depends on is modified. PythonTeX
longdesc also provides syntax highlighting for code in LaTeX documents
longdesc via the Pygments syntax highlighter. The package provides a
longdesc depythontex utility, that creates a copy of the document in
longdesc which all Python code has been replaced by its output. This is
longdesc useful for journal submissions, sharing documents, and
longdesc conversion to other formats.
