shortdesc TeX made easy
longdesc Lollipop is "TeX made easy" -- it is a macro package that
longdesc functions as a toolbox for writing TeX macros. Its main aim is
longdesc to make macro writing so easy that implementing a fully new
longdesc layout in TeX would become a matter of less than an hour for an
longdesc average document. The aim is that such a task could be
longdesc accomplished by someone with only a very basic training in TeX
longdesc programming. Thus, Lollipop aims to make structured text
longdesc formatting available in environments where typical users would
longdesc switch to WYSIWYG packages for the freedom that such a
longdesc mechanism offers. In addition, development of support for
longdesc Lollipop documents written in RTL languages (such as Persian)
longdesc is underway.
