shortdesc Conversion of punctuation in maths mode
longdesc The package modifies the behaviour of characters in maths mode
longdesc so that: '.' is used as a one-thousand separator (as is common
longdesc in Germany) ',' is used as a decimal separator (as is common in
longdesc Germany) '--' is represented with spacing as appropriate to
longdesc such constructs as '1.000,--'. These conversions may be
longdesc switched on and off.
