shortdesc Visualise the vocal tract using LaTeX and PSTricks
longdesc The package enables the user to visualise the vocal tract. The
longdesc vocal tract (in the package) is manipulated by a vector of
longdesc articulation parameters according to the S. Maeda model.
longdesc Animation may be achieved by providing a sequence of vectors
longdesc over time (e.g., from Matlab). A sequence of vectors for
longdesc certain German phonemes is embedded in the package, which
longdesc allows for animation when no other vector is available. The
longdesc package's graphics are produced using pstricks.
