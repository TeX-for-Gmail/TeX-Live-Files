shortdesc Print a class calendar
longdesc This package is intended to print a term calendar for use in
longdesc planning a class. It has a flexible mechanism for specifying
longdesc which days of the week are to be included and for inserting
longdesc text either regularly on the same day each week, or on selected
longdesc days, or for a series of consecutive days. It also has a
longdesc flexible mechanism for specifing class and nonclass days. Text
longdesc may be inserted into consecutive days so that it automatically
longdesc flows around nonclass days.
