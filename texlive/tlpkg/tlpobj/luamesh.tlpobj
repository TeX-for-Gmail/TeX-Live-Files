shortdesc Computes and draws 2D Delaunay triangulation
longdesc The package allows to compute and draw 2D Delaunay
longdesc triangulation. The algorithm is written with lua, and depending
longdesc upon the choice of the engine, the drawing is done by MetaPost
longdesc (with luamplib) or by TikZ. The Delaunay triangulation
longdesc algorithm is the Bowyer and Watson algorithm. Several macros
longdesc are provided to draw the global mesh, the set of points, or a
longdesc particular step of the algorithm.
