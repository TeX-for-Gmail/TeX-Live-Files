shortdesc Support for PSTricks in pdfTeX
longdesc The PSTricks macros cannot be used (directly) with pdfTeX,
longdesc since PSTricks uses PostScript arithmetic, which isn't part of
longdesc PDF. This package circumvents this limitation so that the
longdesc extensive facilities offered by the powerful PSTricks package
longdesc can be made use of in a pdfTeX document. This is done using the
longdesc shell escape function available in current TeX implementations.
longdesc The package may also be used in support of other
longdesc 'PostScript-output-only' packages, such as PSfrag. For
longdesc alternatives, users may care to review the discussion in the
longdesc PSTricks online documentation.
