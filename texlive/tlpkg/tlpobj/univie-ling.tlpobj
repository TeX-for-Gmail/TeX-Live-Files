shortdesc Papers, theses and research proposals in (Applied) Linguistics at Vienna University
longdesc This bundle provides LaTeX2e classes suitable for student
longdesc papers, PhD research proposals (Exposes), and theses in
longdesc (Applied) Linguistics at the University of Vienna. The classes
longdesc implement some standards for these types of text, such as
longdesc suitable title pages. They are particularly suited for the
longdesc field of (Applied) Linguistics and pre-load some packages that
longdesc are considered useful in this context. The classes can also be
longdesc used for General and Historical Linguistics as well as for
longdesc other fields of study at Vienna University. In this case,
longdesc however, some settings may have to be adjusted.
