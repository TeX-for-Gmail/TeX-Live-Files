shortdesc Draw perspective views of 3D solids
longdesc The package is designed to draw solids in 3d perspective.
longdesc Features include: create primitive solids; create solids by
longdesc including a list of its vertices and faces; faces of solids and
longdesc surfaces can be colored by choosing from a very large palette
longdesc of colors; draw parametric surfaces in algebraic and reverse
longdesc polish notation; create explicit and parameterized algebraic
longdesc functions drawn in 2 or 3 dimensions; project text onto a plane
longdesc or onto the faces of a solid; support for including external
