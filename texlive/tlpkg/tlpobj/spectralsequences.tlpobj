shortdesc Print spectral sequence diagrams using PGF/TikZ
longdesc The package is a specialized tool built on top of PGF/TikZ for
longdesc drawing spectral sequences. It provides a powerful, concise
longdesc syntax for specifying the data of a spectral sequence, and then
longdesc allows the user to print various pages of spectral sequences,
longdesc automatically choosing which subset of the classes,
longdesc differentials, and structure lines to display on each page. It
longdesc also handles most of the details of the layout. At the same
longdesc time, it is extremely flexible. spectralsequences is closely
longdesc integrated with TikZ to ensure that users can take advantage of
longdesc as much as possible of its expressive power. It is possible to
longdesc turn off most of the automated layout features and draw
longdesc replacements using TikZ commands. The package also provides a
longdesc carefully designed error reporting system intended to ensure
longdesc that it is as clear as possible what is going wrong.
