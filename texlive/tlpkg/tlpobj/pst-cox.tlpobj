shortdesc Drawing regular complex polytopes with PSTricks
longdesc Pst-cox is a PSTricks package for drawing 2-dimensional
longdesc projections of complex regular polytopes (after the work of
longdesc Coxeter). The package consists of a macro library for drawing
longdesc the projections. The complex polytopes appear in the study of
longdesc the root systems and play a crucial role in many domains
longdesc related to mathematics and physics. These polytopes have been
longdesc completely described by Coxeter in his book "Regular Complex
longdesc Polytopes". There exist only a finite numbers of exceptional
longdesc regular complex polytopes (for example the icosahedron) and
longdesc some infinite series (for example, one can construct a
longdesc multi-dimensional analogue of the hypercube in any finite
longdesc dimension). The library contains two packages. The first,
longdesc pst-coxcoor, is devoted to the exceptional complex regular
longdesc polytopes whose coordinates have been pre-computed. The second,
longdesc pst-coxeterp, is devoted to the infinite series.
