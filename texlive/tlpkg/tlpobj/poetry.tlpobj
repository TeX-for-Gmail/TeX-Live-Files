shortdesc Facilities for typesetting poetry and poetical structure
longdesc The poetry package provides some macros and general doodads for
longdesc typesetting poetry. There is, of course, already the excellent
longdesc verse package, and the poetrytex package provides some extra
longdesc functionality on top of it. But poetry provides much of the
longdesc same functionality in a bit of a different way, and with a few
longdesc additional abilities, such as facilities for a list of poems,
longdesc an index of first lines, and some structural commands.
