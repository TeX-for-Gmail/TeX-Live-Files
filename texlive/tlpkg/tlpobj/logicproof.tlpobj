shortdesc Box proofs for propositional and predicate logic
longdesc A common style of proof used in propositional and predicate
longdesc logic is Fitch proofs, in which each line of the proof has a
longdesc statement and a justification, and subproofs within a larger
longdesc proof have boxes around them. The package provides environments
longdesc for typesetting such proofs and boxes. It creates proofs in a
longdesc style similar to that used in "Logic in Computer Science" by
longdesc Huth and Ryan.
