shortdesc Typeset books following classical design and layout
longdesc The octavo class is a modification of the standard LaTeX book
longdesc class. Its purpose is to typeset books following classical
longdesc design and layout principles, with the express intention of
longdesc encouraging the making of beautiful books by anyone with access
longdesc to a good printer and with an inclination towards venerable
longdesc crafts, e.g., bookbinding. The octavo class differs from the
longdesc book class by implementing many of the proposals and insights
longdesc of respected experts, especially Jan Tschichold and Hugh
longdesc Williamson. The documentation discusses methods to organise and
longdesc print out any text into signatures, which can then be gathered,
longdesc folded and sewn into a book.
