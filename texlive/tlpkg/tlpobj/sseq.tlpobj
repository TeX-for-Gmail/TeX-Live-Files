shortdesc Typesetting spectral sequence charts
longdesc The package provides commands to draw spectral sequence
longdesc diagrams, providing facilities for clipping and arranging
longdesc multiple symbols so that they do not overlap. The package is
longdesc built using pgf, and shares that systems large demands for TeX
longdesc system memory. Its geometric commands are based on a turtle
longdesc graphics model, and control structures such as loops and
longdesc conditionals are available.
