shortdesc XeLaTeX package for typesetting Greek language documents (beta release)
longdesc This package has been designed so to allow people to typeset
longdesc Greek language documents using XeLaTeX. And it is released in
longdesc the hope that people will use it and spot errors, bugs,
longdesc features so to improve it. Practically, it provides all the
longdesc capabilities of the greek option of the babel package. The
longdesc package can be invoked with any of the following options:
longdesc monotonic (for typesetting modern monotonic Greek), polytonic
longdesc (for typesetting modern polytonic Greek), and ancient (for
longdesc typesetting ancient texts). The default option is monotonic.
longdesc The command \setlanguage{<lang>} to activate the hyphenation
longdesc patterns of the language <lang> This, however, can be done only
longdesc if the format file has not been built with the babel mechanism.
