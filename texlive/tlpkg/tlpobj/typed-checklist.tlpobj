shortdesc Typesetting tasks, goals, milestones, artifacts, and more in LaTeX
longdesc The main goal of this package is to provide means for
longdesc typesetting checklists in a way that stipulates users to
longdesc explicitly distinguish checklists for goals, for tasks, for
longdesc artifacts, and for milestones -- i.e., the type of checklist
longdesc entries. The intention behind this is that a user of the
longdesc package is coerced to think about what kind of entries he/she
longdesc adds to the checklist. This shall yield a clearer result and,
longdesc in the long run, help with training to distinguish entries of
longdesc different types.
